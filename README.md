# wise-project
 WISE Shred Space project creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to input and draw geometric shapes (rectangles, triangles, and circles) on a canvas. The program checks if a given point lies inside the shapes and finds points that are in the intersection of all shapes.
